# Grade-Markbook-Forecaster
This is my A Level Computer Science project. 
I created a grade book which can records grades but also use the recorded grades to predict a child's future performance. 
This was done but taking the marks of previous students and creating a linear regression model. 
I used Tkinter to create a GUI.
This was developed to help my current employer.
